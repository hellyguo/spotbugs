"The easiest way to install SpotBugs is to download a binary distribution."
" Binary distributions are available in :dist:`gzipped tar format <tgz>` "
"and :dist:`zip format <zip>`. Once you have downloaded a binary "
"distribution, extract it into a directory of your choice."

"Usually, extracting a binary distribution will create a directory ending "
"in spotbugs-|release|. For example, if you extracted the binary "
"distribution from the C:\\\\Software directory, then the SpotBugs "
"software will be extracted into the directory "
"C:\\\\Software\\\\spotbugs-|release|. This directory is the SpotBugs home"
" directory. We'll refer to it as ``$SPOTBUGS_HOME`` (or "
"``%SPOTBUGS_HOME%`` for Windows) throughout this manual."
